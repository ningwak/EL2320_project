Informtion about processed dataset:


control data:

controlSpeed (in m/secs.)
controlSteering (in radians.)
controlTime (in millisecs.)


measure data:

laserData:
	each cell corresponds to one measurement
	first line in each cell: direction of the detected trees (in radians.)
	second line in each cell: distance from the car to the trees (in m.)
	third line in each cell: radius of each tree (in m.) 
		- used to distinguish between trees
